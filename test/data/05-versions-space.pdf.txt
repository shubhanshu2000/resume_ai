Build a Resume Review Agent
Overview
We’re excited to see your skills in action! This assignment will evaluate your abilities in full-
stack development, understanding of AI/agentic architecture, creativity, and problem-
solving skills. You will build a hosted, working solution that reviews resumes and provides 
personalized career guidance, acting as a career coach for users.
Assignment Details
Objective: Build an agentic platform that allows users to upload their resume. The system 
will review the resume and provide the user with:
• Personalized feedback on their resume.
• Next steps for their career growth.
• Specific advice to help them navigate their career path.
The platform may hosted AI solutions such as Groq or other APIs with free credits. Ideally 
the focus should be on the functionality of the application, especially on UX along with UI

• A chat or canvas based interface for participants to converse with AI
i. We would recommend using https://www.assistant-ui.com/, or other similar 
libraries
• Offer tailored recommendations such as skills to develop, certifications to 
pursue, or industries to explore.
4. Full-Stack Implementation:
• Build a web-based platform with a front-end and back-end.
• Host the solution so it is accessible for review.
Technical Requirements
• The system should be hosted and accessible via a public link.
• You are free to use any programming languages, frameworks, or libraries for both 
the front-end and back-end.
• Implement an agentic architecture that demonstrates creativity and understanding 
of AI technologies.
• AI-assisted coding is allowed, but you must fully understand your implementation 
as you’ll need to explain it during the interview.
• Use APIs, pre-trained models, or any other resources to expedite development.
Deliverables
1. Hosted Solution: Provide a working link to your hosted application.
2. Source Code:
• Share your source code via GitHub or any other repository.
• Include clear documentation on how to set up and run the project locally.
3. ReadMe Documentation:
• Describe the architecture, technologies used, and the rationale behind your 
choices.
• Provide setup instructions and usage details.
4. Demo Video (Optional):
• A short 2–3-minute video showcasing the application’s functionality.
Evaluation Criteria

Submission Instructions
1. Submit your hosted application link, GitHub repository link, and any additional 
deliverables to [provide email/portal details].
2. Deadline: 5 working days (ensure your submission is complete before this date).
3. Be prepared to:
• Walk us through your code during the final interview.
• Explain your approach, choices, and how the agentic architecture is 
implemented.
Additional Notes
• There is no single "right" way to complete this assignment—we encourage creativity 
and innovative problem-solving.
• You will not be judged on how polished the UI is, but clarity and ease of use will be
